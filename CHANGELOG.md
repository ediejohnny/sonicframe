## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Peaks helpers: `readPeaks` reads a list or `{ "peaks": [...] }` and refuses anything else or more than 20,000
  values; `loadPeaks` fetches each address once per page and forgets a failure so it can be tried again; `resample`
  folds peaks keeping each slice's loudest point, or stretches them by blending neighbours; `peaksFromChannel` turns
  decoded samples into exactly the number of peaks asked for, normalized.
- A core that never touches the page, tested in Node: bar geometry in whole device pixels (one width for every bar,
  edge to edge, exactly centered, never overlapping), and playback state driven by a media element's events. A seek
  asked for before the metadata waits for it, a drag seeks once when it is let go, a cancelled drag changes nothing,
  the WAI-ARIA slider keys move by seconds, and the slider's values are written only when they change.
